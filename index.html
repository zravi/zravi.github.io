          <h4 class="project-description"><div class="project-story-title">PROMETHEUS</div>Been a long time since I got to design a website for Hollywood. The few times I have in the past, it was almost never for somebody I respected. When I started out, I dreamt of getting to work on design projects like this one day, for people who contribute their art to popular culture (if you hated the movie, skip the rest of this).<br /><br />The alternate reality campaign for Ridley Scott's first sci-fi film since Blade Runner (his 1984 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYecfV3ubP8" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Story', 'Launch', 'Blake Dunk Video']);">Super Bowl spot</a> for Apple doesn't count), was far reaching. I was asked to design the website for a few products from the film, which takes place in 2094. My first reaction was, "Don't be ridiculous, there won't be products that resemble an iPad or websites that sell them in 2094" but then I remembered, it’s not real! <br /><br />My first illustrations in a decade were done for Weyland's David8 (a human-like cybernetic individual played by Michael Fassbender, indistinguishable from a very, very, creepy human based on Olympic high diver, Greg Louganis) and a few other world-changing (fake) initiatives from Weyland Industries. Designing for sci-fi geeks was scary. It's hard enough to design for you web design geeks.</h4>

This time, the goal was to put a twist on the familiar “Sponsor a Child” by mashing it up with stadium naming rights. The Frankenstein that produced was an ecommerce site where you can purchase naming rights to everything in the shelter. Toilet paper. Tampons. Teddy bears. Towels. And 165 other things that don’t start with a “T.” For example, my wife has had a really rough year medically so I bought naming rights to this <a href="https://www.namesforchange.org/poster/corly-jones-plunger-of-perseverance" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Projects', 'Launch', 'Plunger']);">plunger</a> (1 of only 15). As I write this, it’s still the first week after launch but for every $5k it raises, they can help someone pick up the pieces and get into permanent housing. So far that equals 2 people. I hope to revise this number often.</h4>

          <h4 class="project-description"><div class="project-story-title">ALMOST HUMAN</div>Do I have a sign on my back that says “Humanlike droid expert?” Not that I’m complaining. This is the second time in a year that I’ve done an alternate reality site for a sci-fi film/show which included a droid that looked and acted just like a creepy human. This one was for the JJ Abrams and JH Somebody show about a damaged cop and his damaged droid partner. Buddy cop show meets Star Trek. My wife Corly is way into sci-fi so it was exciting to get to watch the pilot with her before the show aired. Not bad. Got the first three episodes on TiVo but we haven’t finished Breaking Bad yet so it is on ice. It wasn’t exactly tickets to a movie premeire but it was one of the few times I got to impress her with access to exclusive stuff.<br><br>As is increasingly the case these days, the site needed to be built on Tumblr so I called my old pal <a href="http://buddin.us" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'People', 'Launch', 'Brett']);">Brett Buddin</a> who wrestled the Tumblr API to the ground and made it say “Uncle Brett, I give.” It may not look super-complex but that’s because he’s <i>really</i> good at what he does. I’m sure he’s ready for another three year cooling off period until we work together again.</h4>

Make us something interesting.” That’s more or less what these two guys, whom I’ve never met, said when we talked for the first time. I wasn’t sure if I could perform with that much blind trust but it turned out to be my favorite beginning of a project ever. They weren’t sure what they wanted to call themselves right away but after Fictitious was settled on (I love that name), I set about designing a logo (DOUBLE LIGATURES!!!) and this website. The result is an experimental interface that showcases nineteen commercial and entertainmant projects they’ve worked on together over the years. Hope to meet these guys some day so I can say “Thank you for the pleasure” in person.</h4>

I was scared to ask how much they spent but it was barrels more than they paid me to design their logo and the first iteration of the website for their Bitcoin startup. Josh Hawkins is a longtime friend and collaborator and he pulled me in as he and Jeremy Allaire were beginning to put some form to the vision for their followup to Brightcove.com which had its IPO in 2012. When we started in early October, Bitcoin was trading at $175. As I write this it’s at $1100. If I had listened to the voice in my head telling me “These guys know what they’re doing. Let’s invest a little.” when we started, I wouldn’t need to work anymore (but I still would because I love it).</h4>

Co-creator <a href="http://jennysayshi.com/" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'People', 'Launch', 'Jenny Nicholson']);">Jenny Nicholson</a> came up with this crazy idea and somehow convinced everyone at <a href="http://mckinney.com">McKinney</a> and the shelter we did it for, that it was a risk worth taking.

          <h4 class="project-description"><div class="project-story-title">McKINNEY</div>Around February, 2010. Walking back from lunch:<br /><br /><blockquote><i><b>Trevor O'Brien:</b> "Nick, we'd like you to design the new McKinney.com." <br /><b>Me:</b> "GREAT!"<br /><b>Trevor:</b> "You can't use Flash."<br /><b>Me:</b> "You hired the wrong guy."</i></blockquote><br />I was scared to death about designing for the newfangled HTML5, which, as a Flash loyalist, I was convinced was a passing fad. Then I got stuck in a small room with <a href="http://buddin.us" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'People', 'Launch', 'Brett']);">Brett Buddin,</a> who schooled me on the virtues of not being just some dumbass Flash guy who pollutes the web, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ajkarim" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'People', 'Launch', 'aj']);">AJ Karim</a> who cleared a path and kept us focused. I was stubborn and blinded by self preservation but I've come around (this site you're on right now is proof!). <br /><br />The iPad had just come out so we decided early in the process to make the first ever touch-first agency site. I asked Brett if it was possible for him to do a touch slider in mobile Safari. He said, "No." and then proceeded to make it possible by building <a href="https://github.com/brettbuddin/lectric" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'People', 'Launch', 'Lectric']);">one</a>.<br /><br />The space we work in is the best I've ever seen. With photo and design help from <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/parris" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'People', 'Launch', 'TeamParris']);">Team Parris</a>, we brought the best of it to the website.<br /><br />In the last month before launch, I was certain some other, more savvy agency was going to beat us to the touch-first thing. I was obsessing on it so to quiet my fears, I went to the sites of all the best agencies I could think of on my iPhone and took screengrabs as I went. Just before launch, I published those <a href="http://narrowdesign.com/future" target="_blank" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Site', 'Launch', 'Future']);">screenshots</a>. Most everybody in our industry showed up as a blue lego or a phone number. It started the <a href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/advertising-worst-agency-websites-iphones-ipads/145956/" target="_blank">conversation</a> we wanted happening while we launched our first attempt at a device agnostic site (for us, these were pre-responsive web design days).<br /><br />The site became the first to win both <a href="http://thefwa.com/site/mckinney" target="_blank">FWA</a> and <a href="http://thefwa.com/mobile/mckinney" target="_blank">MobileFWA</a> honors.

He hadn't played an NBA game yet because he was hurt during preseason his rookie year. Everybody seemed sure he'd be dominant when he got a chance to play. I wanted to ensure that he had a site that made him look good when he was ready. If I'm being totally honest, I fell short.

The CD was maybe the most talented guy I had ever worked with. The design work I did, was not good. The CD was disappointed and the project was cancelled. It felt horrible. I never want to feel it again.
          <br /><br />
          I failed. Hard. My heart wasn't in it. I followed the wireframes but didn't bring anything special to the work. I wasn't having fun. I didn't believe in the project and it showed.
