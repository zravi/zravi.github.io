This site has been live for a little over a year now. It served me well. The award givers gave it an FWA and an AWWWARDS SOTD. Please feel free to use anything you find useful. Part or all of it for whatever you want. The sites I did for other people might not be as cool with that so limit your use to the site contained in this repo.

It's not as if a lot of people will be willing to dig through this mess of code but for the brave souls who do, I'd be happy to answer questions. I'm definitely doing a lot of things blatantly wrong so please help make me better!

I use Less for my CSS so you'll need that: http://lesscss.org

Let me know if I missed anything else. Good luck!

I have very little idea what I'm doing but I'm having a lot of fun and learning a lot doing it.
